                <li><strong>InKubation:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This component manages Kubernetes environments, reducing efforts in cluster management and deployment by up to 50%.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> It streamlines application deployment and cluster monitoring, making Kubernetes operations more efficient and secure.</p>

                <li><strong>IPro:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> An infrastructure lifecycle management platform that offers cost management, governance control, and health monitoring.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> It provides a centralized interface for managing infrastructure, ensuring that all resources are efficiently utilized and secure.</p>

                <li><strong>RED (RAPID Embedded DevOps):</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A framework for the incremental adoption of DevOps, particularly for embedded systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> It aligns DevOps practices with the software development lifecycle (SDLC) of embedded systems, ensuring secure and efficient operations.</p>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> By integrating security into every stage of the development and operations lifecycle, the framework ensures that vulnerabilities are addressed early, reducing the risk of security breaches.</li>

                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The framework supports scalable operations, making it suitable for enterprises of all sizes, from startups to large corporations.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Specific Backend Tools Used</h2>
            <div class="tool">
                <h3>Docker Jockey (DoJo):</h3>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Provides comprehensive security for containerized applications through vulnerability scanning and auto-remediation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tool">
                <h3>InKubation:</h3>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Manages Kubernetes clusters efficiently, reducing manual effort by up to 50%.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>IPro:</h3>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Centralized infrastructure management with governance, cost control, and health monitoring.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Example for Better Understanding</h2>
            <p>Imagine a healthcare application being developed using HCL’s DevSecOps Framework. Throughout the development process, Docker Jockey continuously scans for vulnerabilities in the application’s containers, automatically fixing any issues it finds. As the application is deployed on Kubernetes, InKubation manages the clusters, ensuring that the deployment is smooth and secure. Meanwhile, IPro monitors the infrastructure to ensure optimal performance and security. This integrated approach ensures that the application is secure, compliant, and efficiently managed from development through deployment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>HCL’s DevSecOps Framework is a robust solution that integrates security into the very fabric of DevOps, ensuring that applications are not only developed and deployed quickly but also securely. This framework is particularly beneficial for organizations that prioritize security and efficiency in their development processes.</p>
