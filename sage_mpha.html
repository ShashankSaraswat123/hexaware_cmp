        <h1>SAGE Framework</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>The SAGE (Solution Architect Group for Enterprise) Framework</strong> by Mphasis is designed to address critical aspects of security, availability, governance, and execution within enterprise IT systems, particularly in cloud data system design and adoption. The framework plays a pivotal role in helping organizations modernize their data ecosystems, ensuring they are secure, scalable, and compliant with regulatory requirements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Components and Features</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Security and Governance:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> SAGE ensures that all data and applications are governed by strict security protocols, ensuring compliance with industry regulations and standards. It manages data ownership, provenance, and adherence to regulatory requirements, making it suitable for industries with stringent compliance needs.</p>

                <li><strong>Data Availability and Execution:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> The framework supports high availability and reliability of data across distributed systems, making sure that enterprise data is accessible and usable when needed. It also provides robust execution capabilities, allowing seamless integration and deployment of new applications or updates without disrupting existing operations.</p>

                <li><strong>Application Clustering and Release Planning:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> SAGE uses a structured approach to application clustering, helping enterprises segregate workloads and data based on their dependencies and lineage. This clustering aids in efficient migration to cloud environments and ensures that releases are planned and executed without affecting ongoing operations.</p>

                <li><strong>Workstreams and Parallel Testing:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> The framework allows the creation of dedicated execution workstreams, or "swim-lanes," for various programs, enabling agile delivery. Additionally, it supports parallel testing (often referred to as the "side-car" approach) of legacy and new systems to build confidence in data accuracy and system performance before full deployment.</p>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Security and Compliance:</strong> SAGE provides comprehensive security measures and governance models, ensuring that enterprise systems are compliant with regulations and protected against threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved Data Availability:</strong> By ensuring high availability and reliability of data, the framework supports uninterrupted business operations and enhances decision-making processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Cloud Migration:</strong> The application clustering and release planning components streamline the migration process, reducing the risk of disruptions and ensuring that new systems integrate smoothly with existing ones.</li>
                <li><strong>Agile Delivery:</strong> The workstreams and parallel testing features support agile methodologies, enabling faster and more flexible deployment of new systems and updates.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Specific Backend Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <div class="tool">
                <h3>Data Governance Tools</h3>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> These tools manage data lineage, provenance, and compliance, ensuring that all data within the enterprise adheres to regulatory standards. Examples include tools like Informatica Data Governance and Collibra.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tool">
                <h3>Automation and Orchestration Tools</h3>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> These tools automate deployment, testing, and release processes, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency. Examples include Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes for container orchestration.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tool">
                <h3>Cloud Integration Platforms</h3>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> These platforms enable seamless integration of on-premises and cloud environments, supporting hybrid cloud architectures. Tools like AWS Direct Connect and Azure ExpressRoute are commonly used for this purpose.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section section-example">
            <h2>Simple Example</h2>
            <p>Consider a healthcare organization migrating its data and applications to the cloud. Using the SAGE Framework, the organization can ensure that patient data is securely managed and compliant with health regulations like HIPAA. The application clustering feature helps the IT team group applications based on their dependencies, making the migration process smoother. Meanwhile, parallel testing ensures that both legacy and new systems are working correctly before the full transition is made, minimizing risks and ensuring a seamless migration experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The SAGE Framework by Mphasis is essential for enterprises looking to modernize their IT infrastructure securely, efficiently, and in a compliant manner, especially when migrating to cloud environments.</p>
