            <h2>Simple Example for Better Understanding</h2>
            <p>Imagine a large manufacturing company that wants to reduce its carbon footprint. They implement a carbon management platform that integrates with IoT sensors placed throughout their facilities. These sensors track energy usage in real-time, feeding data back to the platform. The platform’s analytics tools identify that one production line is particularly energy-intensive. The company then decides to upgrade the machinery on that line to more energy-efficient models, reducing energy consumption and, consequently, their carbon emissions. The platform also generates quarterly reports to ensure compliance with environmental regulations, providing stakeholders with transparent updates on the company’s progress toward its sustainability goals.</p>
