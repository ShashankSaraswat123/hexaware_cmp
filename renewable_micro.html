    </header>

    <main>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>Renewable Energy Integration</strong> refers to the process of incorporating renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro into the energy mix of power systems, ensuring that they work seamlessly with traditional energy sources. This integration is crucial for reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Example for Better Understanding</h2>
            <p>Imagine a utility company integrating solar and wind energy into its power grid. During sunny and windy days, excess energy is stored in batteries. When production drops, the stored energy is released to meet demand. The smart grid dynamically adjusts, ensuring a stable supply without overloading the system. This integration reduces the need for fossil fuel-based power plants, lowers emissions, and provides a reliable energy supply even during fluctuations in renewable energy production.</p>
