        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>Edge Computing</strong> refers to a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, improving response times and saving bandwidth. <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>, when integrated with Edge Computing, enhances the capability of edge devices to process and analyze data locally, enabling real-time decision-making without relying on centralized cloud services. This combination is critical for applications requiring low latency, high reliability, and real-time processing, such as autonomous vehicles, industrial IoT, and smart healthcare.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Edge devices collect and process data at the source, reducing the need to send large volumes of data to centralized cloud servers. This local processing reduces latency and bandwidth usage.</p>

                <li><strong>Embedded AI:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> AI algorithms embedded within edge devices enable real-time data analysis and decision-making at the edge.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Embedded AI can perform tasks such as predictive maintenance, anomaly detection, and real-time analytics directly on the device, enhancing the speed and efficiency of operations.</p>

                <li><strong>Connectivity:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Edge devices are connected to each other and to centralized cloud platforms via various communication protocols, including 5G, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Connectivity ensures seamless data exchange between edge devices and the cloud, enabling hybrid computing models where critical tasks are processed at the edge while more complex analysis is conducted in the cloud.</p>

                <li><strong>Security:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Security measures in edge computing environments include encryption, secure boot, and real-time threat detection to protect data and devices from unauthorized access.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> These security features ensure that the data processed and stored on edge devices remains secure and that the system is resilient against cyber threats.</p>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduced Latency:</strong> By processing data closer to the source, edge computing minimizes the delay between data generation and processing, which is crucial for applications like autonomous driving or industrial automation.</li>
                <li><strong>Bandwidth Optimization:</strong> Edge computing reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted to the cloud, optimizing bandwidth usage and reducing costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The decentralized nature of edge computing allows for easy scaling as new devices can be added to the network without overwhelming a central server.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Processing data locally reduces the risk of data breaches during transmission, as less data is sent over potentially insecure networks.</li>
