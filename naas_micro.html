        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>Network as a Service (NaaS)</strong> is a cloud-based networking model that provides enterprises with the ability to access, manage, and operate their network infrastructure without the need to own or maintain physical hardware. This model enables organizations to scale their network services based on demand while also ensuring that they remain secure and efficient. Microland's NaaS offering is built on a platform-centric delivery model that integrates various network functions, security, and management tools into a single, centrally managed solution.</p>

                <li><strong>Experience-Level Agreements (XLAs):</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Unlike traditional Service Level Agreements (SLAs), which focus on uptime and availability, Microland’s NaaS emphasizes Experience-Level Agreements. XLAs are designed to ensure that end-user experience is prioritized, with specific metrics and benchmarks tied to user satisfaction and performance outcomes.</p>

                <li><strong>Security Integration:</strong></li>
