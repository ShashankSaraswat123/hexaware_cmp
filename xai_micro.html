        <h1>Explainable AI (XAI) Overview</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>Explainable AI (XAI)</strong> is a set of processes and methods designed to make the decision-making processes of AI systems more transparent and understandable to humans. The goal of XAI is to open the "black box" of AI, providing insights into how AI models arrive at specific decisions or predictions. This transparency is crucial in building trust, ensuring accountability, and enabling the validation and improvement of AI systems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Components and Features</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Model Interpretability:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> XAI focuses on creating models that are either interpretable by design or can be explained post-hoc. This includes methods like decision trees, which are inherently interpretable, and techniques such as LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for explaining complex models.</p>

                <li><strong>Transparency:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> XAI emphasizes making AI systems more transparent. This involves clearly documenting the data, algorithms, and decisions involved in the AI process, so users can understand how and why a model produced a particular outcome.</p>

                <li><strong>Post-Hoc Explanation:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> These are techniques used to explain models after they have been trained. Examples include feature importance scoring, visualizations of decision boundaries, and counterfactual explanations that show how changing input variables could alter the AI's output.</p>

                <li><strong>User-Centric Design:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> XAI is designed with the end-user in mind, ensuring that explanations are understandable and useful for the target audience, whether they are technical experts, business leaders, or general consumers.</p>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Improved Trust:</strong> By making AI systems more understandable, XAI builds trust among users, who can see and verify how decisions are made.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> In industries like finance and healthcare, regulations often require transparency in decision-making. XAI helps meet these requirements by providing clear explanations for AI-driven decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Bias Detection and Mitigation:</strong> XAI can help identify and correct biases in AI models, leading to fairer and more ethical AI applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Model Validation:</strong> By understanding how a model works, data scientists and engineers can more effectively validate and improve AI systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Specific Backend Tools and Their Functionality</h2>
            <div class="tool">
                <h3>LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)</h3>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LIME is a popular tool that explains the predictions of any machine learning model by approximating it locally with an interpretable model. This allows users to understand which features are most influential in a particular decision.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tool">
                <h3>SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)</h3>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> SHAP values are a method from cooperative game theory that explain the output of machine learning models. SHAP provides consistent and locally accurate attributions for each feature in a prediction, making it easier to understand complex models.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tool">
                <h3>Microland’s AI and IoT Platform</h3>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Microland integrates AI with explainability features into its industrial platforms, ensuring that users can understand how AI-driven insights are generated. This is particularly important in mission-critical environments where decisions need to be both accurate and justifiable.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section section-example">
            <h2>Simple Example</h2>
            <p>Consider an AI system used in a bank to approve or reject loan applications. If a customer’s application is rejected, XAI tools like LIME or SHAP can be used to explain which factors (e.g., credit score, income, debt-to-income ratio) contributed to the rejection. The bank can then provide the customer with a clear and understandable explanation, increasing transparency and trust in the decision-making process. Furthermore, if the system is found to be biased against certain demographics, the bank can adjust the model to make fairer decisions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Microland’s approach to XAI in industrial settings involves using AI models that provide actionable insights while also ensuring that the decision-making process is clear to the platform users, enhancing both the effectiveness and the reliability of the AI solutions.</p>
