            <h2>Key Components and Features</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Embedded AI:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Embedded AI refers to the integration of artificial intelligence directly into hardware devices, enabling real-time decision-making without relying on cloud connectivity. This is particularly useful in scenarios where low latency and immediate responses are crucial, such as in autonomous vehicles or medical devices.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Embedded AI processes data locally on the device, utilizing machine learning models that are optimized for efficiency and speed. This reduces dependency on external data centers and allows for faster processing and decision-making.</p>

                <li><strong>IoT Edge Computing:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> IoT Edge computing involves processing data at the edge of the network, closer to where it is generated, rather than sending it to a centralized cloud server. This approach reduces latency, saves bandwidth, and improves the responsiveness of IoT applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> IoT Edge devices collect and analyze data in real-time, enabling immediate actions based on insights. This is essential for applications like predictive maintenance in industrial settings or real-time health monitoring in connected medical devices.</p>

                <li><strong>Security and Compliance:</strong></li>
