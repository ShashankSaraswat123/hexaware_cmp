    <main>
        <div class="section">
            <p>The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) represents a rapidly growing network of connected medical devices, software applications, and healthcare systems that communicate over the internet to manage patient health outcomes. This ecosystem allows for real-time monitoring, data collection, and analysis, providing healthcare providers with unprecedented insights into patient care. The IoMT is pivotal in transforming traditional healthcare practices by enabling personalized treatment, reducing hospital visits, and improving overall healthcare efficiency.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Components and Features</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Connected Medical Devices:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Wearable Devices:</strong> Smartwatches, fitness trackers, and wearable ECG monitors are used to track vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and activity levels. These devices continuously collect data and transmit it to healthcare systems for monitoring and analysis.</p>
                <p><strong>Implantable Devices:</strong> Devices like pacemakers and glucose monitors provide real-time data on patients' physiological parameters, allowing for continuous monitoring and timely interventions.</p>

            <h2>Example for Better Understanding</h2>
            <p>Consider a patient with diabetes who uses a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) as part of the IoMT ecosystem. The CGM continuously tracks the patient's blood glucose levels and sends the data to a cloud-based platform. The platform, powered by AI and machine learning, analyzes the data in real-time. If the system detects a significant fluctuation in glucose levels that could indicate a potential health risk, it immediately alerts both the patient and their healthcare provider. The provider can then take proactive steps, such as adjusting the patient's medication or diet, to prevent a more serious health issue.</p>
            <p>This example demonstrates how IoMT can provide continuous, personalized care, allowing for timely interventions and improved management of chronic conditions like diabetes.</p>
