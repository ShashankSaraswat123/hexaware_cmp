    <main>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Technology</strong> enables electric vehicles (EVs) to interact dynamically with the power grid. This technology allows EVs not only to draw power from the grid to charge their batteries but also to return stored energy back to the grid. V2G helps balance energy supply and demand, particularly during peak load times, making the grid more stable and efficient.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Components and Features</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bidirectional Charging Infrastructure</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This is the core feature of V2G technology. Unlike standard EV charging systems that only allow energy to flow from the grid to the vehicle, bidirectional chargers enable the reverse flow as well.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> During off-peak times or when the vehicle is not in use, the stored energy in the EV’s battery can be fed back into the grid, helping to stabilize it and provide energy during high demand periods.</p>

                <li><strong>Smart Grid Integration</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> V2G technology relies on a smart grid that can manage the two-way energy flow between the EV and the grid.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> The smart grid uses real-time data to balance energy loads, adjust supply, and manage the distribution of electricity from various sources, including renewable energy and stored energy from EVs.</p>

                <li><strong>Communication Protocols (ISO 15118)</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> These protocols ensure standardized and secure communication between the EV, the charging station, and the grid.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> ISO 15118, for example, facilitates the exchange of data required for V2G operations, including the initiation of charging, billing, and energy transfer processes, ensuring compatibility across different systems and regions.</p>

                <li><strong>Cybersecurity Measures</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> With V2G systems involving networked communication, robust cybersecurity is crucial to protect against potential attacks.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Security features such as encryption algorithms (e.g., ECDSA for digital signatures) and secure communication protocols help protect the integrity and confidentiality of the data exchanged between EVs and the grid.</p>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Benefits of V2G Technology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Grid Stability:</strong> V2G helps to smooth out the fluctuations in energy demand and supply, making the grid more resilient, especially when integrated with renewable energy sources.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> For EV owners, V2G can provide financial incentives by allowing them to sell stored energy back to the grid, particularly during peak demand times.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> By integrating renewable energy sources with V2G, overall carbon emissions can be reduced, contributing to a more sustainable energy ecosystem.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Specific Backend Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <div class="tool">
                <h3>Bidirectional Chargers</h3>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> These devices facilitate the flow of electricity in both directions—charging the EV battery and discharging it back to the grid. They are essential for enabling V2G capabilities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tool">
                <h3>Smart Charging Software Platforms</h3>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Platforms like KPIT's smart charge solutions manage the interaction between the EV and the grid, including load balancing, billing, and energy distribution. These platforms ensure that energy exchange occurs efficiently and securely.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tool">
                <h3>Communication Controllers (EVCCs)</h3>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> These controllers manage the communication between the EV and the grid according to standards like ISO 15118. They ensure that all interactions, including charging and discharging, are compliant with global protocols and secure from cyber threats.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tool">
                <h3>Cybersecurity Tools</h3>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Tools like OpenSSL libraries are used to secure V2G communication channels by encrypting data and ensuring that all transactions are authenticated and protected from malicious attacks.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section section-example">
            <h2>Simple Example for Understanding</h2>
            <p>Imagine an electric vehicle parked at home during a hot summer day when the energy demand peaks. The V2G system detects the high demand and automatically discharges stored energy from the EV’s battery back into the grid to help balance the load. Later, when the grid demand decreases, the EV recharges its battery during off-peak hours at a lower cost, ensuring it’s ready for the next drive. This cycle helps both the grid and the EV owner, demonstrating the practical benefits of V2G technology.</p>
        </div>
