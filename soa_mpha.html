    </header>

    <main>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)</strong> is a design framework that enables the integration of various services, allowing different applications and systems to communicate and work together. SOA focuses on breaking down business processes into individual services that can be reused and orchestrated to build more complex applications. This approach enhances agility, scalability, and interoperability within enterprises, making it easier to adapt to changing business needs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Components and Features</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Services:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> These are the building blocks of SOA, representing self-contained business functions that are accessible over a network.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Services are designed to be loosely coupled, meaning they are independent of each other and can be reused across different applications.</p>

                <li><strong>Enterprise Service Bus (ESB):</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> An ESB acts as a communication layer that facilitates the interaction between services.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> It enables seamless integration and communication between disparate services, managing data transformation, routing, and message handling.</p>

                <li><strong>Service Registry:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A directory where all available services are listed.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> This allows services to be discovered and invoked dynamically by other services or applications, ensuring scalability and flexibility.</p>

                <li><strong>Orchestration:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The process of combining multiple services to create more complex business processes.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> Orchestration allows for the automation of business workflows, making it easier to manage and optimize processes.</p>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> SOA allows organizations to scale services independently, enabling better resource management and the ability to handle increased loads without affecting the entire system.</li>
                <li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Services can be reused across different applications, reducing development time and costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Agility:</strong> SOA supports quick adaptation to new business requirements by allowing the integration of new services without disrupting existing systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> SOA ensures that different systems, even those built on diverse platforms, can communicate effectively through standardized interfaces.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Specific Backend Tools and Their Functionality</h2>
            <div class="tool">
                <h3>Mphasis EAI Solutions</h3>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Mphasis provides comprehensive Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) services that leverage SOA to connect various business applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> These solutions integrate disparate back-end systems, provide a single view of customer data, and enable the modernization of legacy systems for better agility and scalability.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tool">
                <h3>TIBCO Center of Excellence (CoE)</h3>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A specialized service offering that integrates SOA with DevOps and business process integration.</p>
                <p><strong>Functionality:</strong> The TIBCO CoE facilitates the incremental adoption of SOA, allowing businesses to migrate gradually while maintaining operational continuity.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section section-example">
            <h2>Example for Better Understanding</h2>
            <p>Consider a large financial institution that manages multiple services, such as customer account management, loan processing, and fraud detection. Using SOA, each of these functions is broken down into individual services. For instance, the loan processing service can be accessed independently by different applications within the institution, such as online banking, branch office systems, and mobile apps. If the bank wants to add a new feature, like a personalized loan recommendation system, it can do so by integrating a new service without disrupting the existing ones. This modular approach ensures that the bank can quickly adapt to new market demands while maintaining system stability and performance.</p>
