    </header>

    <main>
        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>Conversational AI</strong> involves using artificial intelligence to enable machines to interact with humans through text or speech in a natural and human-like manner. This technology underpins chatbots, virtual assistants, and AI-driven customer service platforms, allowing them to understand, process, and respond to human language effectively.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Components</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Understanding:</strong> NLP helps in understanding the nuances of human language, including syntax, semantics, and intent.</p>
                <p><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> It determines the emotional tone behind a series of words to understand the user's mood.</p>
                <p><strong>Named Entity Recognition (NER):</strong> Identifies entities like names, dates, and locations in the conversation.</p>

                <li><strong>Machine Learning and Deep Learning:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Training Models:</strong> Conversational AI uses machine learning algorithms to improve its performance over time by learning from past interactions.</p>
                <p><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Models are trained with labeled data, improving their accuracy in recognizing and responding to user inputs.</p>
                <p><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Enhances the system by rewarding correct responses, allowing the AI to learn optimal conversation strategies.</p>

                <li><strong>Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech (TTS):</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> Converts spoken language into text that the AI system can understand and process.</p>
                <p><strong>Text-to-Speech:</strong> Converts the AI's textual responses back into speech, making it possible to create voice-based interactions.</p>

                <li><strong>Context Management:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Maintaining Context:</strong> Allows the AI to keep track of the conversation context, which is crucial for providing coherent and relevant responses.</p>
                <p><strong>Multi-Turn Conversations:</strong> Enables the AI to handle complex interactions that span multiple exchanges.</p>

                <li><strong>Dialogue Management:</strong></li>
                <p><strong>Decision-Making:</strong> Manages the flow of the conversation, deciding what the AI should say next based on the user’s input and the conversation history.</p>
                <p><strong>Response Generation:</strong> Synthesizes responses that are appropriate and contextually relevant to the user’s queries.</p>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
