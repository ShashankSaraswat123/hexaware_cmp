            <h2>Example for Better Understanding</h2>
            <p>Consider a financial institution that handles vast amounts of sensitive data. An Intelligent SOC would continuously monitor the institution’s network for any signs of suspicious activity, such as unusual login patterns or unauthorized data transfers. If a potential threat is detected, the SOC can automatically trigger an incident response protocol, isolating affected systems and mitigating the threat before it escalates. The SOC would also use threat intelligence to anticipate new types of attacks, ensuring the institution's defenses are always up-to-date.</p>
